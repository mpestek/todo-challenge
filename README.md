# Todo

This simple Todo App was a challenge done in 2 and a half hours.

## Requirements:
1. User can view all todos in a list.
2. User can add new todos.
3. A todo item contains:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Completed status indication
    - Favorite inidication
    - Expiry Date
4. User can delete todos. The deletion of a todo must be confirmed before it is executed.
5. All todo properties should be editable.
6. The todos should be stored in a cache, which (including all cache operations) is represented by a service.
7. If a field is empty when creating or editing a todo, an error message is displayed and the process is not continued.
8. If the input of the email field is changed, the error message disappears immediately after input/deletion of a character.
9. Todos should always be sorted by completes/not completed and then either by importance+date or by date+importance.
10. Overdue todos - i.e. todos with expired due date - should be visually highlighted.
